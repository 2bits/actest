/* Define to nothing if C supports flexible array members, and to 1 if it does
   not. That way, with a declaration like `struct s { int n; double
   d[FLEXIBLE_ARRAY_MEMBER]; };', the struct hack can be used with pre-C99
   compilers. When computing the size of such an object, don't use 'sizeof
   (struct s)' as it overestimates the size. Use 'offsetof (struct s, d)'
   instead. Don't use 'offsetof (struct s, d[0])', as this doesn't work with
   MSVC and with C++ compilers. */
