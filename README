Autoconf-2.68b test results.

The autoconf-2.68b testsuite fails randomly on 64bit OSX Lion 10.7.3.
This repo is a collection of tests/testsuite.dir/NNN directories
from many runs of make -j 1 check.

  tests/testsuite.dir/302

Would be in the repo as simply 302.
The commonality is a diff in .before and .after env files.

Thanks for looking.
