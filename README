Autoconf-2.68b+4MAR2012 Patches

The autoconf-2.68b testsuite with patches attached to bug-autoconf,
continues to fail randomly on 64bit OSX Lion 10.7.3.

This repo contains the testsuite.dir/NNN directories
This repo contains ac268b.diff, the current patch collection used.

This data comes from about ten runs of:

  rm -rf everything
  extract tarball & cd
  configure
  make
  make -j 1 check
  cd ..
  rm -rf everything

The commonality is a diff in .before and .after env files.
Thanks for looking.


UPDATE: 7 MAR 2012 - Paul put a possible fix for this issue that caused
more tests to fail, and the test results from that run are all named
by the Run 10 commit message, directories 280-299.  The patch used has
been added to ac268b.diff for viewing.
