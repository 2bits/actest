Autoconf-2.68b test results.

The autoconf-2.68b testsuite fails randomly on OSX Lion 10.7.3.
This repo is a collection of man runs of make -j 1 check,
where the failed subdirectories are placed here in the repo
for easy examination.

  tests/testsuite.dir/302

That directory for example is in the repo as simply 302.
The commonality is a diff in .before and .after env files.

Thanks for looking.
